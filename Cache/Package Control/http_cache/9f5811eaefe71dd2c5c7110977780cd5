As such\nthis change goes through existing documentation to remove the\nannotations that marked items as being for dev builds only, since they\nare now currently stable.\n\nThere will likely be an upcoming change for this as it was missed by the\nofficial team that some of the plugins that are referenced in the API\ndocumentation as example plugins were removed in build 3189.\n\nWhen that change goes live (which will probably be in the next couple of\ndays, if I had to guess), another update will be pushed for this.","tree":{"sha":"0479148fb03d0ed3cb685255f8d8eaf4d3f11f2f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/STealthy-and-haSTy/SnAPI/git/trees/0479148fb03d0ed3cb685255f8d8eaf4d3f11f2f"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/STealthy-and-haSTy/SnAPI/git/commits/6e04e432e94ee058b26f301306a785dbf485626d","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/STealthy-and-haSTy/SnAPI/commits/6e04e432e94ee058b26f301306a785dbf485626d","html_url":"https://github.com/STealthy-and-haSTy/SnAPI/commit/6e04e432e94ee058b26f301306a785dbf485626d","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/STealthy-and-haSTy/SnAPI/commits/6e04e432e94ee058b26f301306a785dbf485626d/comments","author":{"login":"OdatNurd","id":13212876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjEyODc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13212876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd","html_url":"https://github.com/OdatNurd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"OdatNurd","id":13212876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjEyODc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13212876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd","html_url":"https://github.com/OdatNurd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdatNurd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"a03cff1313e05b2e536951a7c79205151624a94c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/STealthy-and-haSTy/SnAPI/commits/a03cff1313e05b2e536951a7c79205151624a94c","html_url":"https://github.com/STealthy-and-haSTy/SnAPI/commit/a03cff1313e05b2e536951a7c79205151624a94c"}]}]
